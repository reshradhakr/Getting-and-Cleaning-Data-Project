# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

	The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
	The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
	We should create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Download the dataset we need to work on.
2) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional information about the variables, data and transformation can be found in the CodeBook.md file.
